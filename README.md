# Phaser Boilerplate

Phaser Boilerplate is a blank and solid place to get up and running quickly with a new phaser game project.

Phaser Boilerplate is built using [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and of course [Phaser.](http://phaser.io/)

## Getting Started

Phaser Boilerplate is simple and easy to get started with, but it does require a few things.

### Gulp
You will need gulp to run a number of tasks that will build your game for you, automagically.

For help with Gulp installation and basic usage please [visit.](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

### Sass
Phaser Boilerplate also uses sass, a css pre-processor.

For more information and help with Sass please [visit.](http://sass-lang.com/)

For more information and help with Compass please [visit.](http://compass-style.org/)

## Tasks

**gulp watch** - This default task will re-build your project when files are changed.
